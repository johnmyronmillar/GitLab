# Agile Project Management Guidelines

The proposal statement, presentation, and deliverables are the official required deadlines. Most software development processes use some form of agile approach. For our cohort, in an effort to continuously improve and raise the quality of your projects, we will implement the following deadlines due at the end of each class:

* Day 1: Submit your propsal statement in a Word Document on Slack including:
    * The kind of data or subject area you will use
    * The kinds of questions you will ask of the data
    * One or more data sources that will meet your requirements

* Day 2: Submit your progress in a Word Document on Slack including:
    * A link to your dataset and a description of it (size, columns, missing data, etc)
    * The questions your project will address
    * The packages you plan to use (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
    * The methods you plan to use (visualizing frequency, linear regression, time series, etc.)

* Day 3: A dry-run 5-minute class presentation of your progress so far. We will provide feedback for implementation in your next iteration.

* Day 4: Submit your proposed revisions and additions in a Word Document on Slack.

* Day 5: Submit your slides for the presentation. You may continue making edits before the presentation but this should be substantially complete. Use your slides to visually tell your story. Use the written report for longer narrative explanations.

* Day 6 (Final Day): The entire class is reserved for presentations.

* Final Day + 1: Your written report and any other deliverables are due the day after your presentations. Your written reports should be written elaborations on the presentation format given in the [presentation guidelines](PresentationGuidelines.md).

In addition to your final README reports, each member needs to write an individual post-mortem describing how the project went and what each group member contributed. This can be between one paragraph and one page. Submit this as an additional link to a Google Doc in BCS. 

While not required, you are encouraged to document your agile process using any preferred tools such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) which is a free online tool. If you use a tool, you are encouraged to take a screen shot of the process and include it in your written report under Methods.
